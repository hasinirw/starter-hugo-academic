I am a speech scientist and a doctoral student in [Stepp Lab for Sensorimotor Rehabilitation Engineering](https://sites.bu.edu/stepplab/) at Boston University. My overarching research goal is applying neuroengineering to enhance quality of life of individuals with neurological diseases that affect speech and voice.  As a graduate research assistant in Stepp lab, my research focuses on using auditory & somatosensory motor perturbations of voice and speech to develop neurocomputational models of speech motor control for motor speech disorders. 

I am also an electronics engineer by training, having received my B.S. in Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering, and working in the industry prior to joining graduate school. My undergraduate research was focused on objective hearing screening of newborns via automated auditory brain stem responses.
